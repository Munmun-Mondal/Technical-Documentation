         <h4>What is CSS?</h4>
         <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to styles web pages. Cascading Style Sheets are fondly referred to as CSS. The reason for using this is to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. It allows you to apply styles on web pages. More importantly, it enables you to do this independently of the HTML that makes up each web page.</p> 
        <h5>Why learn CSS?</h5>
        <p>Styling is an essential property for any website. It increases the standards and overall look of the website that makes it easier for the user to interact with it. A website can be made without CSS, as styling is MUST since no user would want to interact with a dull and shabby website. So for knowing Web Development, learning CSS is mandatory.</p>
        <p><b>CSS Code Format:</b> It is the basic structure of the CSS style of a webpage.</p>>

          <p>body {<br>
              background-color: lightgray;<br>
          }<br>
          h1 {<br>
              color: green;<br>
              text-align: center;<br>
          }<br>
          p {<br>
              font-family: sans-serif;<br>
              font-size: 16px;<br>
          }</p>
         <p> Types of CSS: There are three types of CSS which are given below.</p> 

          <li><b>Inline:</b>Inline CSS contains the CSS property in the body section attached with the element known as inline CSS.</li>
          <li><b>Internal or Embedded:</b>The CSS ruleset should be within the HTML file in the head section i.e the CSS is embedded within the HTML file.</li>
          <li><b>External:</b>External CSS contains a separate CSS file that contains only style property with the help of tag attributes.
          </li>
          <P><b>Example:</b> Let’s see a small example of HTML webpage with CSS styles. Here, we use styles to set the alignment and text color of a webpage.</P>
         <P><B>CSS Key Features:</B></P>
         <LI>CSS specifies how HTML elements should be displayed on screens.</LI>
         <LI>The Major key feature of CSS includes styling rules which are interpreted by the client browser and applied to various elements.</LI>
         <LI>Using CSS, you can control the color text, the style of fonts, spacing between elements, how columns are sized, variation in display for different devices and screen size as well as a variety of other effects.</LI><br>
        <h5><b>CSS Functions</b></h5>
        <p><b>CSS functions</b> are used to set the various CSS property. For example, the attr() function is used to retrieve the value of the HTML attribute. </p>

          <h6><b>Advantages of CSS:</b></h6>
          <li>CSS plays an important role, by using CSS you simply got to specify a repeated style for element once & use it multiple times as because CSS will automatically apply the required styles.</li>
          <li>The main advantage of CSS is that style is applied consistently across variety of sites. One instruction can control several areas which is advantageous.</li>
          <li>Web designers needs to use few lines of programming for every page improving site speed.</li>
          <li>Cascading sheet not only simplifies website development, but also simplifies the maintenance as a change of one line of code affects the whole web site and maintenance time.</li>
          <li>It is less complex therefore the effort are significantly reduced.</li>
          <li>It helps to form spontaneous and consistent changes.</li>
          <li>CSS changes are device friendly. With people employing a batch of various range of smart devices to access websites over the web, there’s a requirement for responsive web design.</li>
          <li>It has the power for re-positioning. It helps us to determine the changes within the position of web elements who are there on the page.</li>

          <li>With CSS, what works with one browser might not always work with another. The web developers need to test for compatibility, running the program across multiple browsers.</li>
          <li>After making the changes we need to confirm the compatibility if they appear. The similar change affects on all the browsers.</li>
          <li>The programming language world is complicated for non-developers and beginners. Different levels of CSS i.e. CSS, CSS 2, CSS 3 are often quite confusing.</li>
          <li>Browser compatibility (some styles sheet are supported and some are not).</li>
          <li>CSS works differently on different browsers. IE and Opera supports CSS as different logic.</li>
          <li>There might be cross-browser issues while using CSS.<br>
