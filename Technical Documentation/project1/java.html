         <h5>Simple Hello World Program :</h5>
         <p>// A Java program to print "Hello World"<br> 
          public class GFG { <br>
              public static void main(String args[]) <br>
              { <br>
                  System.out.println("Hello World"); <br>
              } <br>
          }<br>
          <b>Output: </b><br>
          Hello World
        </p>
         <h5>Implementation of a Java application program involves a following step. They include:</h5>
         <ol>
            <li>"Creating the program</li>
            <li>Compiling the program</li>
            <li>Running the program</li>
            </ol>
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li><B> Creating Program</B></li>
                <p>We can create a program using Text Editor (Notepad) or IDE (NetBeans).</p>
<pre><code>
class Test
{
    public static void main(String []args)
    {
        System.out.println("My First Java Program.");
    }
}
</code></pre>
<P>File -> Save -> d:\Test.java</P>
                <li><B>Compiling the program</B></li>
                <p> To compile the program, we must run the Java compiler (javac), with the name of the source file on “command prompt” like as follows.<br>
                If everything is OK, the “javac” compiler creates a file called “Test.class” containing byte code of the program.</P>

                <li><B>Running the program</B></li>
                <p> We need to use the Java Interpreter to run a program.</p>
            </ul>

      <h6><b>Java Terminology</b>></h6> 
      <ol>
        <li><b>Java Virtual Machine(JVM):</b>This is generally referred to as JVM. There are three execution phases of a program. They are written, compile and run the program.</li>

            <li>Writing a program is done by a java programmer like you and me.</li>
            <li>The compilation is done by the <b>JAVAC</b>> compiler which is a primary Java compiler included in the Java development kit (JDK). It takes the Java program as input and generates bytecode as output.</li>
            <li>In the Running phase of a program, JVM executes the bytecode generated by the compiler.</li>
        <br>
        <p>Now, we understood that the function of Java Virtual Machine is to execute the bytecode produced by the compiler. Every Operating System has a different JVM but the output they produce after the execution of bytecode is the same across all the operating systems. This is why Java is known as a <b>platform-independent language.</b></p>
        <li><b>Bytecode in the Development Process: </b>As discussed, the Javac compiler of JDK compiles the java source code into bytecode so that it can be executed by JVM. It is saved as .class file by the compiler. To view the bytecode, a disassembler like javap can be used.</li>
        <li><b>Java Development Kit(JDK):</b>While we were using the term JDK when we learn about bytecode and JVM. So, as the name suggests, it is a complete Java development kit that includes everything including compiler, Java Runtime Environment (JRE), java debuggers, java docs, etc. For the program to execute in java, we need to install JDK on our computer in order to create, compile and run the java program.</li>
        <li><b>Java Runtime Environment (JRE): </b>JDK includes JRE. JRE installation on our computers allows the java program to run, however, we cannot compile it. JRE includes a browser, JVM, applet support, and plugins. For running the java program, a computer needs JRE.</li>
        <li><b> Garbage Collector: </b>In Java, programmers can’t delete the objects. To delete or recollect that memory JVM has a program called Garbage Collector. Garbage Collectors can recollect the objects that are not referenced. So Java makes the life of a programmer easy by handling memory management. However, programmers should be careful about their code whether they are using objects that have been used for a long time. Because Garbage cannot recover the memory of objects being referenced.</li>
        <li><b> ClassPath:</b>The classpath is the file path where the java runtime and Java compiler look for .class files to load. By default, JDK provides many libraries. If you want to include external libraries they should be added to the classpath.</li>

      </ol> 
      <h5><b>Primary/Main Features of Java</b></h5>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Platform Independent:</b>Compiler converts source code to bytecode and then the JVM executes the bytecode generated by the compiler. This bytecode can run on any platform be it Windows, Linux, or macOS which means if we compile a program on Windows, then we can run it on Linux and vice versa. Each operating system has a different JVM, but the output produced by all the OS is the same after the execution of the bytecode. That is why we call java a platform-independent language.</li>
        <li><b>Object-Oriented Programming Language:</b>Organizing the program in the terms of a collection of objects is a way of object-oriented programming, each of which represents an instance of the class.</li>
        <br>
        <h6>The four main concepts of Object-Oriented programming are:</h6>

        <ul>
          <li>Abstraction</li>
          <li>Encapsulation</li>
          <li>Inheritance</li>
          <li>Polymorphism</li>
       </ul>
      </ol>    
      <ol>
        <li><b>Simple: </b>Java is one of the simple languages as it does not have complex features like pointers, operator overloading, multiple inheritances, and Explicit memory allocation. </li>
        <li><b> Robust: </b>Java language is robust which means reliable. It is developed in such a way that it puts a lot of effort into checking errors as early as possible, that is why the java compiler is able to detect even those errors that are not easy to detect by another programming language. The main features of java that make it robust are garbage collection, Exception Handling, and memory allocation.</li>
        <li><b>Secure:</b> In java, we don’t have pointers, so we cannot access out-of-bound arrays i.e it shows <b>ArrayIndexOutOfBound Exception </b>if we try to do so. That’s why several security flaws like stack corruption or buffer overflow are impossible to exploit in Java. Also, java programs run in an environment that is independent of the os(operating system) environment which makes java programs more secure.</li>
      <li><b> Distributed:  </b>We can create distributed applications using the java programming language. Remote Method Invocation and Enterprise Java Beans are used for creating distributed applications in java. The java programs can be easily distributed on one or more systems that are connected to each other through an internet connection.</li>
      <li><b>Multithreading: </b>Java supports multithreading. It is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of the CPU.</li>
      <li><b>Portable: </b>As we know, java code written on one machine can be run on another machine. The platform-independent feature of java in which its platform-independent bytecode can be taken to any platform for execution makes java portable.</li>
      <li><b> High Performance:</b>Java architecture is defined in such a way that it reduces overhead during the runtime and at some times java uses Just In Time (JIT) compiler where the compiler compiles code on-demand basics where it only compiles those methods that are called making applications to execute faster.</li>
      <li><b>Dynamic flexibility:</b>Java being completely object-oriented gives us the flexibility to add classes,  new methods to existing classes, and even create new classes through sub-classes. Java even supports functions written in other languages such as C, C++ which are referred to as native methods.</li>
      
      </ol>
      <h5><b>Example:</b></h5>
      <p><b>Java</b></p>
      <p>// Importing classes from packages<br>
        import java.io.*;<br>
       // Main class<br>
        public class GFG {<br>
          // Main driver method<br>
          public static void main(String[] args)<br>
         {<br>
            // Print statement<br>
            System.out.println("Welcome to GetknowWebDev");<br>
          }<br>
        }</p>
       <h5><b>Output:</b></h5>
       <p>Welcome to GetknowWebDev</p>
       <h5><b>Explanation:</b></h5>
       <ol>
        <li><b>Comments:</b>Comments are used for explaining code and are used in a similar manner in Java or C or C++. Compilers ignore the comment entries and do not execute them. Comments can be of a single line or multiple lines.</li>
        <h6><b>Single line Comments:</b></h6>
        <h6><b>Syntax:</b></h6>
        <p>// Single line comment</p>
        <h6><b>Multi-line comments:</b></h6>
        <h6><b>Syntax:</b></h6>
        <p>/* Multi line comments*/</p>
        <li><b>import java.io.*:</b>This means all the classes of the io package can be imported. Java io package provides a set of input and output streams for reading and writing data to files or other input or output sources.</li>
        <li><b>class:</b>The class contains the data and methods to be used in the program. Methods define the behavior of the class. Class GFG has only one method Main in JAVA.</li>
        <li><b>static void main(): </b>static keyword tells us that this method is accessible without instantiating the class. </li>
        <li><b>void: </b>keywords tell that this method will not return anything. The main() method is the entry point of our application.</li>
        <li><b>System.in: </b>This is the <b>standard input stream </b>that is used to read characters from the keyboard or any other standard input device.</li>
        <li><b>System.out: </b>This is the <b>standard output stream</b> that is used to read characters from the keyboard or any other standard input device.</li>
        <li><b>println(): </b>This method in Java is also used to display text on the console. It prints the text on the console and the cursor moves to the start of the next line at the console. The next printing takes place from the next line.</li>
        <li><b>String[]args : </b>This is the argument passed to the main function which is an array of strings with the array name args. One can choose their own flexible name but this name is used by many developers.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Everything in java is represented in Class as an object including the main function.</p>
        <h5><b>IMPORTANT POINTS OF JAVA:</b></h5>
        <ol>
          <li>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that was first released in 1995.</li>
            <li>Java is platform-independent, which means that code written in Java can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.</li>
            <li>Java code is compiled into bytecode, which can then be executed by the JVM.</li>
            <li>Java is known for its “write once, run anywhere” philosophy, which makes it a popular choice for cross-platform development.</li>

           <li> Java has a robust exception-handling mechanism that makes it easier to handle errors and unexpected behavior in code.</li>
           <li> Java supports multithreading, which makes it possible to write programs that can perform multiple tasks simultaneously.</li>
        </ol>
      <h5><b>Advantages of Java:</b></h5> 
      <ol>
        <li><u>Platform independent:</u> Java code can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, which means that applications can be written once and run on any device.</li>
        <li><u>Object-Oriented:</u> Java is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it follows the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.</li>
        <li><u>Security:</u> Java has built-in security features that make it a secure platform for developing applications, such as automatic memory management and type checking.</li>
        <li><u>Large community:</u> Java has a large and active community of developers, which means that there is a lot of support available for learning and using the language.</li>
        <li><u>Enterprise-level applications:</u> Java is widely used for developing enterprise-level applications, such as web applications, e-commerce systems, and database systems.</li>
      </ol> 
      <h5><b>Disadvantages of Java:</b></h5>
      <ol>
        <li>Performance: Java can be slower compared to other programming languages, such as C++, due to its use of a virtual machine and automatic memory management.</li>
        <li>Memory management: Java’s automatic memory management can lead to slower performance and increased memory usage, which can be a drawback for some applications.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4 style="color:blue"><b><u><center> Abstraction in Java</center></u></b></h4>>
      <P><b>Abstraction</b> is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.</P>
      <h5><b>Abstract class in Java:</b></h5>
      <p>A class which is declared as abstract is known as an <b>abstract class</b>. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods. It needs to be extended and its method implemented. It cannot be instantiated.</p>
      <h6><b>Points to Remember</b></h6>
        <li>An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword.</li>
        <li>It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.</li>
        <li>It cannot be instantiated.</li>
        <li>It can have constructors and static methods also.</li>
        <li>It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.</li>

      <h6><b>Example of abstract class</b></h6>
      <p><b>abstract class</b> A{}  </p>
      <h5><b>Abstract Method in Java:</b></h5>
      <p>A method which is declared as abstract and does not have implementation is known as an abstract method.</p>
      <h6><b>Example of abstract method</b></h6>
      <p><b>abstract void</b> printStatus();//no method body and abstract  </p>
      <h5><b>Example of Abstract class that has an abstract method</b></h5>
      <p>In this example, Bike is an abstract class that contains only one abstract method run. Its implementation is provided by the Honda class.</p>
      <p>abstract class Bike{ <br> 
        abstract void run(); <br> 
      } <br> 
      class Honda4 extends Bike{<br>  
      void run(){System.out.println("running safely");}  <br>
      public static void main(String args[]){  <br>
       Bike obj = new Honda4();  <br>
       obj.run(); <br> 
      } <br> 
      }  </p>
      <h6><b>Output:</b></h6>
      <p>running safely</p>
      <h5><b>Why do we use abstract?</b></h5>
      <p><b>Here are some reasons why we use abstract in Java:</b></p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Abstraction:</b><br>Abstract classes are used to define a generic template for other classes to follow. They define a set of rules and guidelines that their subclasses must follow. By providing an abstract class, we can ensure that the classes that extend it have a consistent structure and behavior. This makes the code more organized and easier to maintain.</li>
      <li><b>Polymorphism: </b><br>Abstract classes and methods enable polymorphism in Java. Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. This means that a variable of an abstract type can hold objects of any concrete subclass of that abstract class. This makes the code more flexible and adaptable to different situations.</li>
      <li><b>Frameworks and APIs:</b><br>Java has numerous frameworks and APIs that use abstract classes. By using abstract classes developers can save time and effort by building on existing code and focusing on the aspects specific to their applications.</li>
      </ol>
      <h5><b>Encapsulation vs Data Abstraction</b></h5>
        <li>Encapsulation is data hiding(information hiding) while Abstraction is detailed hiding(implementation hiding).</li>
          <li>While encapsulation groups together data and methods that act upon the data, data abstraction deal with exposing the interface to the user and hiding the details of implementation.</li>
          <li>Encapsulated classes are Java classes that follow data hiding and abstraction We can implement abstraction by using abstract classes and interfaces.</li> 
          <li>Encapsulation is a procedure that takes place at the implementation level, while abstraction is a design-level process.</li><br>
      <h6><b>Advantages of Abstraction</b></h6>
      <ol>
        <li>It reduces the complexity of viewing things.</li>
        <li>Avoids code duplication and increases reusability.</li>
        <li>Helps to increase the security of an application or program as only essential details are provided to the user.</li>
        <li>It improves the modularity of the application.</li>
        <li>Hides implementation details and exposes only relevant information.</li>
        <li>Provides a clear and simple interface to the user.</li>
        <li>Abstraction provides a way to hide the complexity of implementation details from the user, making it easier to understand and use.</li>
        
        <li>Abstraction enables modularity and separation of concerns, making code more maintainable and easier to debug.</li>
       
      </ol>
      <h6><b>Disadvantages of Abstraction in Java:</b></h6>
      <ol>
        <li>Abstraction can make it more difficult to understand how the system works.</li>
        <li>It can lead to increased complexity, especially if not used properly.</li>
        <li>This may limit the flexibility of the implementation.</li>
        <li>Abstraction can add unnecessary complexity to code if not used appropriately, leading to increased development time and effort.</li>
        <li>Abstraction can make it harder to debug and understand code, particularly for those unfamiliar with the abstraction layers and implementation details.</li>
        <li>Overuse of abstraction can result in decreased performance due to the additional layers of code and indirection.</li>
      </ol>
      <h6><b>A real-life example of data abstraction:</b></h6>
      <p>A real-life example of data abstraction is a car’s dashboard. The dashboard provides a simplified interface to the driver, abstracting away the complexity of the car’s internal systems.<br>

        The dashboard provides key information such as the speed, fuel level, and engine temperature, which are necessary for the driver to operate the car safely. The driver does not need to know the intricate details of how the car’s engine or transmission works in order to drive the car. Instead, the dashboard presents a simplified, high-level view of the car’s status, allowing the driver to focus on the task of driving.<br>
        
        In this example, the car’s internal systems represent the underlying implementation details that are hidden from the driver. The dashboard provides the abstraction layer that simplifies the interface between the driver and the car, making it easier to operate. The abstraction layer also provides flexibility in the implementation of the car’s internal systems, allowing changes to be made without affecting the driver’s experience.</p>
        <h4 style="color: blue;"><b><u><center>Encapsulation in Java</center></u></b></h4>
        <p>Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates.</p>
        <h6><b>Advantages of Encapsulation:  </b></h6>
          <li><b>Data Hiding: </b>it is a way of restricting the access of our data members by hiding the implementation details. Encapsulation also provides a way for data hiding. The user will have no idea about the inner implementation of the class. It will not be visible to the user how the class is storing values in the variables. The user will only know that we are passing the values to a setter method and variables are getting initialized with that value.</li>
          <li><b>Increased Flexibility: </b>We can make the variables of the class read-only or write-only depending on our requirements. If we wish to make the variables read-only then we have to omit the setter methods like setName(), setAge(), etc. from the above program or if we wish to make the variables write-only then we have to omit the get methods like getName(), getAge(), etc. from the above program</li>
          <li><b>Reusability:</b> Encapsulation also improves the re-usability and is easy to change with new requirements.</li>
          <li><b>Testing code is easy: </b>Encapsulated code is easy to test for unit testing.</li>
          <li><b>Freedom to programmer in implementing the details of the system: </b>This is one of the major advantage of encapsulation that it gives the programmer freedom in implementing the details of a system.

        <h4 style="color: blue;"><u><b><center>Inheritance in Java</center></b></u></h4>
        <p>Java, Inheritance is an important pillar of OOP(Object-Oriented Programming). It is the mechanism in Java by which one class is allowed to inherit the features(fields and methods) of another class.<br>Inheritance represents the <b>IS-A relationship </b>which is also known as a parent-child relationship.</p>
        <h5><b>Why Do We Need Java Inheritance?</b></h5>
          <li><b>Code Reusability: </b>The code written in the Superclass is common to all subclasses. Child classes can directly use the parent class code.</li>
          <li><b>Method Overriding:</b> Method Overriding is achievable only through Inheritance. It is one of the ways by which Java achieves Run Time Polymorphism.</li>
          <li><b>Abstraction: </b>The concept of abstract where we do not have to provide all details is achieved through inheritance. Abstraction only shows the functionality to the user.</li><br>
        <h6><b>Important Terminologies Used in Java Inheritance</b></h6>
          <li><b>class: </b>Class is a set of objects which shares common characteristics/ behavior and common properties/ attributes. Class is not a real-world entity. It is just a template or blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.</li>
          <li><b>Super Class/Parent Class: </b>Superclass is the class from where a subclass inherits the features. It is also called a base class or a parent class.</li>
          <li><b>Sub Class/Child Class:</b>Subclass is a class which inherits the other class. It is also called a derived class, extended class, or child class.</li>
          <li><b>Reusability: </b>Inheritance supports the concept of “reusability”, i.e. when we want to create a new class and there is already a class that includes some of the code that we want, we can derive our new class from the existing class. By doing this, we are reusing the fields and methods of the existing class.</li><br>
        <h5><b>How to Use Inheritance in Java?</b></h5>
        <p>The <b>extends keyword </b>is used for inheritance in Java. Using the extends keyword indicates you are derived from an existing class. In other words, “extends” refers to increased functionality.</p>
       <p> <b>Syntax :</b><br> 

          class derived-class extends base-class <br> 
          {  <br>
             //methods and fields <br> 
          }  </p>
          <h5><b>Java Inheritance Types</b></h5>
          <p>Below are the different types of inheritance which are supported by Java.<br>
           1.Single Inheritance<br>
          2.Multilevel Inheritance<br>
            3.Hierarchical Inheritance</p>
            <h6><b>Advantages Of Inheritance in Java:</b></h6>
            <p>1.Code Reusability: Inheritance allows for code reuse and reduces the amount of code that needs to be written. The subclass can reuse the properties and methods of the superclass, reducing duplication of code.<br>
              2.Abstraction: Inheritance allows for the creation of abstract classes that define a common interface for a group of related classes. This promotes abstraction and encapsulation, making the code easier to maintain and extend.<br>
              3.Class Hierarchy: Inheritance allows for the creation of a class hierarchy, which can be used to model real-world objects and their relationships.<br>
              4.Polymorphism: Inheritance allows for polymorphism, which is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. Subclasses can override the methods of the superclass, which allows them to change their behavior in different ways.</p>
              <h6><b>Disadvantages of Inheritance in Java:</b></h6>
              <p>1.Complexity: Inheritance can make the code more complex and harder to understand. This is especially true if the inheritance hierarchy is deep or if multiple inheritances is used.<br>
                2.Tight Coupling: Inheritance creates a tight coupling between the superclass and subclass, making it difficult to make changes to the superclass without affecting the subclass.</p>
                <h4 style="color: blue;"><u><b><center>Polymorphism in Java</center></b></u></h4>
                <p><b>Polymorphism</b>is considered one of the important features of Object-Oriented Programming. Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways. In other words, polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations. The word “poly” means many and “morphs” means forms, So it means many forms.</p>
                <h5><b>Types of Java polymorphism</b></h5>
                <p>In Java polymorphism is mainly divided into two types: </p>
                  <li><b>Compile-Time Polymorphism :</b>It is also known as static polymorphism. This type of polymorphism is achieved by function overloading or operator overloading. </li>
                  <p><b>Method Overloading: </b>When there are multiple functions with the same name but different parameters then these functions are said to be overloaded. Functions can be overloaded by changes in the number of arguments or/and a change in the type of arguments.</p>
                  <h6><b>Example :</b></h6>
                  <p>class Adder{<br>  
                    static int add(int a, int b)<br>
                    {<br>
                      return a+b;<br>
                    }  <br>
                    static double add(double a, double b)<br>
                    {<br>
                      return a+b;<br>
                    }  <br>
                  }  <br>
                    class TestOverloading2{ <br> 
                    public static void main(String[] args){ <br> 
                    System.out.println(Adder.add(11,20)); <br> 
                    System.out.println(Adder.add(12.3,12.6)); <br> 
                    }<br>
                  }  </p>
                  <p><b>output:</b><br>31<br>24.9</p>
                  <li><b>Runtime Polymorphism:</b>It is also known as Dynamic Method Dispatch. It is a process in which a function call to the overridden method is resolved at Runtime. This type of polymorphism is achieved by Method Overriding. Method overriding, on the other hand, occurs when a derived class has a definition for one of the member functions of the base class. That base function is said to be overridden.</li>
                  <p><b>Method Overriding: </b>In Java, Overriding is a feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes. When a method in a subclass has the same name, the same parameters or signature, and the same return type(or sub-type) as a method in its super-class, then the method in the subclass is said to override the method in the super-class.</p>

              <h5><b>Advantages of Polymorphism in Java</b></h5>
              <ol><li>Increases code reusability by allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common class.</li>
                <li>Improves readability and maintainability of code by reducing the amount of code that needs to be written and maintained.</li>
                <li>Supports dynamic binding, enabling the correct method to be called at runtime, based on the actual class of the object.</li>
                <li>Enables objects to be treated as a single type, making it easier to write generic code that can handle objects of different types.</li>
